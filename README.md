# Abterra-I

The Abterra I is a computer built in minecraft without the use of any command blocks or mods. This computer differs from other minecraft computers in a few ways:
<ul>
<li>Small and simple instruction set.</li>
<li>Instruction and data stored in the same place.</li>
<li>Programs can be written from the control room.</li>
</ul>
<p>To actually figure out how the machine works and how the computer works and how to program it download the manual at https://www.kznarsk.xyz/abterra/AbterraI%20manual.pdf</p>

The minecraft computer itself is not on this github page, because it is not a text document.
